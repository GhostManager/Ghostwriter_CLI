Golang code for the `ghostwriter-cli` binary in [Ghostwriter](https://github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter). This binary provides control for various aspects of Ghostwriter's configuration.

## Usage

Execute `./ghostwriter-cli help` for usage information (see below). More information about Ghostwriter and how to manage it with `ghostwriter-cli` can be found on the [Ghostwriter Wiki](https://ghostwriter.wiki/).

```plaintext
Ghostwriter CLI is a command line interface for managing the Ghostwriter
application and associated containers and services. Commands are grouped by their use.

Usage:
  ghostwriter-cli [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  config      Display or adjust the configuration
  containers  Manage Ghostwriter containers with subcommands.
  help        Help about any command
  install     Builds containers and performs first-time setup of Ghostwriter.
  logs        Fetch logs for Ghostwriter services.
  running     Print a list of running Ghostwriter services.
  test        Runs Ghostwriter's unit tests in the development environment.

```

## Compilation

The binaries distributed with Ghostwriter and attached to releases are compiled with the following command to set version and build date information:

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w -X 'github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter_CLI/cmd/config.Version=`git describe --tags --abbrev=0`' -X 'github.com/GhostManager/Ghostwriter_CLI/cmd/config.BuildDate=`date -u '+%d %b %Y'`'" -o ghostwriter-cli main.go
```

The version for rolling releases is set to `rolling`.

Builds pass through `upx` with `upx --brute ghostwriter-cli`. This is simply so that the standard ~8.5MB Golang file is compressed down to a ~2.5MB file for easier inclusion with the Ghostwriter repo.

All releases include the MD5 hash of the packed binary so you can verify the downloaded binary matches the release. Compile and pack the code with the above commands (or use the pre-compiled binary from a release or Ghostwriter) and then calculate the hash with `md5sum` for comparison. Note that hashes will be different if your command sets different version and build date information.
